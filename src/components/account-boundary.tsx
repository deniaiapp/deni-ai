 * Keeps one account's cached queries and mounted component state away from the

 * tree unmounting (home, auth and app layouts mount separate trees around the
 * same browser client), and each boundary also remembers whose state its own
 * children hold, since a tree kept hidden by Activity can render again after
 * another boundary has already switched the cache.
 *
 * Nothing is rendered while a different identity, or a still-loading session,
 * would see another account's cache. On a switch (sign-out, sign-in, another
 * account, a change made in another tab), or when the session first resolves
 * after queries ran unowned, those queries are cancelled and removed, then the
 * tree mounts again with fresh state. The same account refreshing its session
 * keeps everything.
